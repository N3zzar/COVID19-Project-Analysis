# Data Cleaning and Transformation
After i had imported the comfirmed cases on excel via the web option, i transformed it using the power query editor in order to clean it. I did some edits like making sure the data is updated live, i promoted the first row of the data as header, then made sure the fields in those columns aligned to the data type expected of them and that the header also is consistent with it as well. Then i replicated the afore mentioned steps with the other two data (Recovered cases, death cases). Then i closed and loaded it back into excel. From the loaded data, i made several pivot table out of which i made several pivot charts and gathered all of them into a dahsboard. You can find the dashboard by going through the file i uploaded.
